Browse & Search â€“ Advertisers explore available screens and filter by category.

Ad Uploads â€“ Support for image and video advertisements with metadata (duration, size, tags).

Booking System â€“ Daily or time-slot rentals with conflict prevention.

Wishlist â€“ Save and manage favorite screens.

Messaging â€“ Real-time chat with read receipts, emoji support, and image sharing.

Payments â€“ Secure transactions via Stripe Connect with delayed payouts.

Calendar View â€“ Intuitive date picker showing available and booked days.
